This document gives an introduction to strongSwan for new users (or for existing
users wanting to catch-up).

== Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader of this document...

* understands the principles of networking, from setting IP addresses and DNS servers
  to basic firewalling

* grasps the basic authentication concepts based on public-key cryptography and a
  public-key infrastructure (PKI)

* knows how to install binary software packages or how to compile source code
  following instructions

* is adept on the console

If you don't have such knowledge, there exist many ready-to-use appliances that
provide remote IPsec access.

== Securing a Network

strongSwan is a complete xref:howtos/ipsecProtocol.adoc[IPsec] solution providing
encryption and authentication to servers and clients. strongSwan can be used to
secure communications with remote networks, so that connecting remotely is the
same as connecting locally.

image::topology.png[topology]

Gateway ::
  The gateway is usually your firewall but this can be any host within your network.
  Often the gateway is also able to serve a small network with DHCP and DNS.
  In the image above the hosts `*moon*` and `*sun*` serve as gateways for the
  internal hosts `*alice*`, `*venus*` and `*bob*`, respectively.

Remote Access / Roadwarrior Clients ::
  Usually, roadwarriors are laptops and other mobile devices connecting remotely
  to your home network via the *gateway*. In the image above `*carol*` and `*dave*`
  represent roadwarriors who want to access either of the two networks behind the
  two gateways.

Remote Hosts / Host-to-Host ::
  This can be a remote web server or a backup system. This is illustrated in the
  image by host `*winnetou*` and either of the gateways `*moon*` and `*sun*`. The
  connection between the two hosts can usually be initiated by either one of them.

Remote Sites / Site-to-Site ::
  Hosts in two or more subnets at different locations should be able to access
  each other. Again referring to the image above, the two subnets `*10.1.0.0/16*`
  and `*10.2.0.0/16*` behind gateways `*moon*` and `*sun*`, respectively, might be
  connected, so that e.g. the hosts `*alice*` and `*bob*` may securely communicate
  with one another.

On our website you'll find dozens of complete
xref:config/IKEv2.adoc[configuration examples] covering these and similar situations.

== IKE and IPsec Basics

*strongSwan* is basically a keying daemon that uses the
xref:howtos/ipsecProtocol.adoc#_internet_key_exchange_version_2_ikev2[Internet Key Exchange Version 2]
(IKEv2) protocol to establish *Security Associations* (SAs) and negotiate
*Security Policies* (SPs) between two peers.
For legacy applications {IKE}[IKEv1] is still supported, although we strongly
discourage from using IKEv1 due to stability and some security reasons (it is now
{RFC9395}[officially deprecated]).

IKE provides strong authentication of both peers and derives unique
cryptographically-strong session keys. Such an IKE session is often denoted
*IKE_SA* in our documentation.
Besides authentication and key material IKE also provides the means to exchange
configuration information (e.g. xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses) and
to negotiate IPsec SAs, which are often called *CHILD_SAs*. IPsec SAs define which
network traffic is to be secured and how it has to be encrypted and authenticated.

A CHILD_SA consists of two components:

. The actual IPsec SAs (two of them are established, one in each direction) describing
  the algorithms and keys used to encrypt and authenticate the traffic.

. The policies (there are at least two) that define which network traffic shall use
  that SA.

The policies work both ways, i.e. only traffic matching an inbound policy will be
allowed after decryption. Policies are derived from the *traffic selectors* (TS)
negotiated via IKE when establishing a CHILD_SA. Unprotected traffic that the kernel
receives and for which there is *no* matching inbound IPsec policy will be dropped.
This is a security feature.

The actual {IPSEC}[IPsec traffic] is not handled by *strongSwan* but will be relegated
to the network and IPsec stack of the operating system kernel. *strongSwan* installs
the negotiated IPsec SAs and SPs into the kernel by using a platform-dependent
*kernel interface*.

The mentioned distinction between policies and SAs often leads to *misconceptions*.
For instance, referring to the image above, if host `*moon*` has a site-to-site
tunnel to host `*sun*` (connecting the two networks `*10.1.0.0/16*` and
`*10.2.0.0/24*`) and host `*carol*` has a roadwarrior connection to host `*sun*`
(from which `*carol*` received a virtual IP address of `*10.3.0.10*`). Then `*carol*`
won't be able to automatically communicate with `*alice*`, even if forwarding is
enabled on `*sun*`.  This is because there is no IPsec policy allowing traffic
between `*carol*` (`*10.3.0.10*`) and `*alice*` (`*10.1.0.10*`). An additional SA
between `*moon*` and `*sun*` connecting the virtual subnet `*10.3.0.0/24*` with
`*10.1.0.0/16*` would be a possible solution to this issue.

Generally, IPsec processing and routing are not directly related. IPsec is often
just bumped into the network stack and matching traffic is processed
transparently (*policy-based*). So any routes to the remote TS will technically
work for packets to get forwarded and processed by IPsec. However, source address
selection can be a problem when traffic is sent from the VPN host itself. If the
local TS don't include its "public" address, traffic would not get processed if
the source address is e.g. selected based on the default route. This is
particularly true if virtual IP addresses are used. So to ensure that an address
from a local TS is selected as source, the strongSwan
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] IKE daemon, by default, installs specific
routes to the remote TS for most CHILD_SAs (excluded are e.g. those that use
transport mode or TS with specific ports/protocol).

An alternative approach is xref:features/routeBasedVpn.adoc[*route-based* IPsec]
that uses interfaces and explicit routes to control what packets are going to be
processed by IPsec tunnels (traffic routed that way still has to match the
negotiated policies).

== Authentication Basics

To ensure that the peer with which an IKE_SA is established is really who it claims
to be, it has to be authenticated.

strongSwan provides several methods to do this:

Public Key Authentication ::
  RSA, ECDSA or EdDSA X.509 certificates are used to verify the authenticity of
  the peer.

* Certificates can be self-signed (in which case they have to be installed on
  all peers) or signed by a common Certificate Authority (CA). The latter
  simplifies deployment and configuration a lot as the gateway only needs the
  CA certificate to authenticate all peers that provide a valid certificate
  signed by that CA.

* {CRL}[Certificate Revocation Lists] (CRLs) or the
  {OCSP}[Online Certificate Status Protocol] (OCSP) may be used to verify the
  validity of certificates.

* To securely store private keys xref:howtos/smartcards.adoc[smartcards] may be
  used via the xref:plugins/pkcs11.adoc[`*pkcs11*`] plugin.

* In order to prevent {MITM}[man-in-the-middle attacks], the identity claimed by
  the peer has to be confirmed by the certificate, either by the `*subjectDn*` or
  a `*subjectAltName*` extension.

Pre-Shared-Key Authentication (PSK) ::
  A pre-shared-key is an easy-to-deploy option but it *requires strong secrets*
  to be secure.

* If the PSK is known to many users (which is often the case with IKEv1 XAuth with
  PSK) any user who knows the secret could impersonate the gateway. Therefore this
  method is *not recommended* for large scale deployments.

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) ::
  This covers several possible authentication methods, some are based on
  username/password-based authentication (EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAPv2, EAP-GTC) or on
  X.509 certificates (EAP-TLS). Some can even tunnel other EAP methods (EAP-TTLS,
  EAP-PEAP).

* The actual authentication of users may be delegated to a RADIUS server with the
  xref:plugins/eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] plugin.

* EAP authentication can only be used with IKEv2 and for some methods with IKEv1
  using the xref:plugins/xauth-eap.adoc[`*xauth-eap*`] plugin.

eXtended Authentication (XAuth) ::
  XAuth provides a flexible authentication framework within IKEv1. It is mainly
  used for username/password-based authentication. Also it is generally used as a
  second authentication method after a mutual authentication based on either
  X.509 certificates or PSK. With _IKEv1 hybrid authentication_ it is however
  possible to authenticate the gateway with a certificate and use XAuth to
  authenticate the client, only.

With IKEv2 it is possible to use multiple authentication rounds ({RFC4739}[RFC 4739]),
for instance to first authenticate the *machine* with an X.509 certificate and then
the *user* with a username/password-based authentication scheme (e.g EAP-MSCHAPv2).
It is also possible to use asymmetric authentication, e.g. by authenticating the
gateway with a certificate and the client with a username/password-based EAP method
in the first authentication round. Please be aware that not all IKEv2 implementations
support the {RFC4739}[RFC 4739] extension.

Again, our website provides dozens of xref:config/IKEv2.adoc[configuration examples]
covering these and other authentication options.

== Configuration Files

The recommended way of configuring strongSwan is via the powerful
xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] control interface and the
xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl*`] command line tool. The
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] configuration file used by
xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl*`] is stored together with certificates and
corresponding private keys in the xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl*`] directory.

Global strongSwan settings as well as plugin-specific configurations are defined
in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`].

Alternatively, the legacy `*stroke*` control interface and the `*ipsec*` command
line tool can be used with the deprecated `*ipsec.conf*` and `*ipsec.secrets*`
configuration files.

=== Other Configuration Sources

The configuration may also be loaded from an
xref:config/sqliteDbSchema.adoc[SQL database] or can be provided by custom plugins.
Using the `*charon-nm*` daemon variant, the
xref:features/networkManager.adoc[NetworkManager] can be used to manage VPN
connections.

== Installation

The xref:install/install.adoc[strongSwan installation] is covered in a separate
xref:install/install.adoc[document].

Using binary packages provided by your distribution is generally recommended, as
it makes maintenance easier. Unfortunately, this means that you are often not able
to use the most recent version.

== Invocation and Maintenance

strongSwan is usually managed with the xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl*`] command
while the IKE xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon*`] is controlled by
`*systemd*` on modern distros. With legacy installations, strongSwan is controlled
by the `*ipsec*` command where `*ipsec start*` will start the `*starter*` daemon
which in turn starts and configures the keying xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`]
daemon.

IKE Connections and CHILD SAs defined in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]
can be started through three different ways:

On traffic ::
  If `*start_action = trap*` is used, IPsec trap policies for the configured
  traffic (defined via `*local_ts*`/`*remote_ts*`) will be installed and traffic
  matching these policies will trigger *acquire events* that cause the daemon to
  establish the required IKE/IPsec SAs. This is also used for passthrough/drop IPsec
  policies, to let specific traffic bypass other policies/SAs or drop it completely.

On startup ::
  CHILD_SAs configured with `*start_action = start*` will automatically be
  established when the daemon is started. They are not automatically restarted when
  they go down for some reason. You need to specify other configuration settings
  (`*dpd_action*` and/or `*close_action*` to restart them automatically but even
  then, the setup is not bullet-proof and will potentially leak packets. You are
  encouraged to use trap policies and read the
  xref:howtos/securityRecommendations.adoc[SecurityRecommendations] to take care
  of any problems.

Manually ::
  A connection that uses no `*start_action*` has to be established manually with
  xref:swanctl/swanctlInitiate.adoc[`*swanctl --initiate*`] or acts passively
  as a responder waiting for a peer/roadwarrior to connect. Depending on the
  configuration, it is also possible to use
  xref:swanctl/swanctlInstall.adoc[`*swanctl --install*`] to install policies manually
  for such connections as `*start_action = trap*` would do it on startup.

After an SA has been established,
xref:swanctl/swanctlTerminate.adoc[`*swanctl --terminate*`] may be used to tear
down the IKE_SA or individual CHILD_SAs.

Whenever the xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] file or credentials
in the xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl*`] directory are changed they may be
reloaded with the different
xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc#_subcommands[`*swanctl --load-..*`] commands. Already
established connections are not affected by these commands (unless
`*start_action = start*` is used). If a configuration update is required, the SAs
or even the daemon must be restarted.

Using the different xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc#_subcommands[`*swanctl --list-..*`]
commands will provide information about loaded or cached certificates, supported
algorithms and loaded plugins.

== Logging and Monitoring

If you run into problems, increasing the log level might help you understand what
exactly went wrong. The different xref:config/logging.adoc[logging options] are
described in a xref:config/logging.adoc[separate document] or the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] man page. Recommended log
settings for debugging problems may be found xref:support/helpRequests.adoc[here].

Whenever you encounter a log message similar to `*received ... error notify*` where
the placeholder `*...*` is e.g. `NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN` or `TS_UNACCEPTABLE`, you
should consult the logs of the *remote peer* in order to find out why that
error notify was generated in the first place.

The xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc#_subcommands[`*swanctl --list-..*`] commands will
provide information about the established and configured connections.

On Linux, the `*iproute2*` package provides the `*ip xfrm state*` and
`*ip xfrm policy*` commands to request detailed information about the IPsec SAs
and policies installed in the kernel.  Adding the `*-s*` option will display extensive
statistical information like the number of transmitted or invalid packages. On other
platforms the `*setkey*` command from the `*ipsec-tools*` package provides similar
information.

`*tcpdump*` and `*wireshark*` are also often useful to debug problems.

When testing a connection with `*ping*`, make sure to select a source IP address
(with the `*-I*` option) that is included in the local traffic selector (also see
xref:#_site_to_site_configurations[Site-to-Site Configurations] below).

== PKI

To use certificate-based authentication you'll need to create either self-signed
certificates or set up a complete public-key infrastructure (PKI), consisting of a
Certificate Authority (CA), optional intermediate CAs and end-entity certificates
plus Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or alternative methods like OCSP to verify
the validity of certificates.

One of the easiest ways to generate certificates is to use the
xref:pki/pki.adoc[`*pki*`] tool. Since setting up a whole PKI can be quite complex
we provide some xref:pki/pkiQuickstart.adoc[simple instructions] to get you started.

OpenSSL is also a widespread alternative to generate certificates, as are several
GUI based xref:pki/caManagement.adoc[CA management utilities].
Microsoft's {ADCS}[Active Directory Certificate Services] (AD CS) could also be
used for large scale PKIs.

=== Certificate Requirements

. The generated end entity certificates need to authenticate the corresponding
  remote IKE ID for peer authentication to succeed.

. To authenticate against another strongSwan instance using one or several certificates
  (also attribute certificates might be used), the certificate must authenticate
  the IKE ID the host is sending.
+
_If Alice tries to authenticate against Bob as Alice (herself) then Alice's certificate
must contain at least one `*subjectAltName*` (SAN) field with the correct type (FQDN)
and the value *Alice* or the `*subjectDistinguishedName*` (DN), not the `*commonName*`
(CN) has to be *Alice*!_
+
In other words you can use the complete `*DN*` or any of the `*SAN*` fields (assuming
the type is correct) as an IKE ID.
See xref:#_notes_regarding_certificates[Notes regarding certificates] for details.

. Additionally, the certificate has to be trusted by Bob, either by being known
  beforehand by Bob to being valid, or the certificate being issued by a certificate
  authority (CA) Bob is trusting.

. For authentication to succeed, the other peer has to possess the complete X.509
  certificate trust chain from root certificate (the root CA) down to the end entity
  certificate (the host or user certificate) including all intermediate certificates
  (intermediate CAs). This is done either by sending any intermediate certificates to
  the remote host or the remote host already having them installed locally.

The requirements for certificate-based authentication with third party IKE
implementations are stated in separate documents for
xref:interop/windowsCertRequirements.adoc[Microsoft Windows] and
xref:interop/ios.adoc#_certificate_requirements[Apple iOS/macOS].

=== Notes regarding Certificates

A root CA certificate which being at the top of the X.509 trust chain, is always
self-signed and can therefore be faked by anyone, is `*never*` sent to another host.
Any peer must install the root CA certificate locally in a trustful way and never
accept any root CA certificates received over the network.

A local certificate is only sent to another host if at least one of the following
settings are true:

. The local host has set `*connections.<conn>.send_cert = always*` in the
  connection definition it is using.

. The remote peer requests a certificate issued by a trusted CA by sending a
  CERTREQ payload to the local peer that indicates one of the CAs in the path
  from the local host's certificate up to its root CA certificate.

== Routing

On Linux, strongSwan installs routes into routing table `*220*` by default and
hence requires the kernel to support policy based routing.

You can make the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon install the routes
into any table you like or you can disable them completely. For that purpose the
`*charon.install_routes*`, `*charon.routing_table*` and `*charon.routing_table_prio*`
settings in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] may be used. When
a tunnel is established between two subnets, xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`]
tries to find local IPs in the tunneled local subnets. Such an IP must be configurd
with *scope global* to be viable for the lookup. If a valid IP is found,
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] will install a route pointing to the remote
subnet where the source IP is set to the found IP. This results in routes like the
following:

 10.1.0.0/24 via 10.2.0.1 src 10.2.0.2

In that example, the local IP would be `*10.2.0.2*`. The remote subnet would be
`*10.1.0.0/24*`. This is done, so packets to the remote subnet are sent with the
correct source IP. Thus the IPsec policies will match and traffic from the local
machine to the remote subnet will be secured by IPsec.

To avoid conflicts with these routes (especially if
xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses are used), the `*kernel-netlink*`
plugin manually parses the host's routing tables to determine a suitable source
address when sending IKE packets. On hosts with a (very) high number of routes this
is quite inefficient. In that case, setting `*charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.fwmark*`
in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] is recommended, as it will
allow using a more efficient source address lookup.

In order to detect connectivity changes, strongSwan parses the events that the kernel
sends when a route is installed or deleted and hence could cause high CPU load when
e.g. running on a system that receives a lot of routes via dynamic routing.
Connectivity change detection can be disabled by setting `*charon.process_route = no*`
in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`].

If IPv6 is used, then make sure to xref:config/IPv6Ndp.adoc[bypass] Neighbor Discovery
Protocol (NDP) traffic if necessary. It is possible that you encounter MSS/MTU
problems when tunneling traffic. Please refer to
xref:howtos/forwarding.adoc#_mtumss_issues[Forwarding and Split-Tunneling] for
details.

== Remote Access Configurations

In this section we present example configurations for common remote access use cases.
In these so called *roadwarrior* scenarios mobile clients will be able to connect to
a remote network.

Because these clients most likely connect from unknown IP addresses, the gateway
will use `*remote_addrs = %any*` to literally accept connections from anywhere.
To simplify xref:howtos/forwarding.adoc[routing traffic back] to the clients and
because roadwarriors are often located behind one or more NAT devices, the use of
xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses is necessary.

The virtual IPs can either be from a distinct subnet or actually from the subnet
behind the gateway by use of the xref:plugins/farp.adoc[`*farp*`] plugin and optionally
the xref:plugins/dhcp.adoc[`*dhcp*`] plugin.

Whether roadwarriors will send all traffic to the gateway or use
xref:howtos/forwarding.adoc[split-tunneling], i.e. only send traffic for specific
destinations through the tunnel, is also something to consider. This is explained
in more details in xref:howtos/forwarding.adoc[Forwarding and Split-Tunneling].
That document also explains how traffic is xref:howtos/forwarding.adoc[forwarded]
to hosts behind the gateway.

=== IKEv2 Configurations

The three strongSwan gateway configurations shown for the
xref:interop/windowsClients.adoc[Windows clients] may be used for all IKEv2 clients:

. xref:/interop/windowsMachineServerConf.adoc[Certificate-based Authentication]

. xref:/interop/windowsUserServerConf.adoc[Certificate-based EAP-TLS Authentication]

. xref:/interop/windowsEapServerConf.adoc[Password-based EAP Authentication]

In all three use cases the gateway is authenticated by a certificate while the
clients either authenticate themselves based on certificates (1, 2) or on
username/password schemes (3). The generic EAP use case (3) incorporates the
EAP-TLS use case (2), so that only two configurations (1, 3) must be implemented
in parallel on a strongSwan VPN gateway to leave it up to the VPN clients to select
any of the three authentication methods above.

With the xref:plugins/eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] plugin, user authentication
may be delegated to a RADIUS server (e.g. an existing Active Directory DC).

Both the xref:os/androidVpnClient.adoc[strongSwan VPN Client for Android] and
xref:features/networkManager.adoc[NetworkManager] may be used with any of the
strongSwan VPN gateway configurations. Alternatively the
xref:daemons/charon-cmd.adoc[`*charon-cmd*`] command line IKEv2 client provides a
simple means to establish roadwarrior connections.

xref:os/macos.adoc#_native_application[Our app for macOS] supports IKEv2 and simple
EAP authentication. With xref:interop/appleIkev2Profile.adoc[iOS 8 and macOS 10.10]
Apple introduced support for IKEv2 in their clients. A GUI to configure such
connections is currently not provided, so it's necessary to write (or generate)
xref:interop/appleIkev2Profile.adoc[custom configuration profiles].

== Site-to-Site Configurations

We provide the following site-to-site
xref:config/IKEv2.adoc#_site_to_site[configuration examples]

The most important difference compared to the remote access case is that the
initiator will not request a xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] address but instead
use `*local_ts*` to tunnel traffic from one or more local subnets. With IKEv2
multiple subnets (in CIDR notation) can be added to `*local_ts*`/`*remote_ts*`
separated by commas. If IKEv1 is used, a separate
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_connections_conn_children[`*children.<child>*`]
subsection has to be added for each combination of local and remote subnet, as only
the first subnet in `*local_ts*`/`*remote_ts*` will be used.

One thing that often confuses users new to IPsec is that testing a net-to-net
scenario from either of the gateways often requires one to select the source address
used specifically (e.g. with `*ping -I*`) because the external IP of either gateway
might not be included in the tunneled subnets. If that is something you require,
either add the external IPs to the list of subnets in `*local_ts*`/`*remote_ts*`
or add a specific host-to-host config.

== Host-to-Host Configurations

Host-to-host connections are very easy to setup. You basically have to set
`*remote_addrs*` to the hostname or IP address of the peer and configure the
desired authentication. Neither the `*local_ts*` nor `*remote_ts*` traffic selectors
have to be set explicitly.

Again, our web site provides some practical host-to-host
xref:config/IKEv2.adoc#_host_to_host[configuration examples].
